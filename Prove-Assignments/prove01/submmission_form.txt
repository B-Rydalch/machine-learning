For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset: 
   TRUE

3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)?
   TRUE

4. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: train and predict. The train method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives.
   TRUE

5. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifierâ€™s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set).
   TRUE

6. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result.
   TRUE

7. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is?
   32.4% accuracy





8. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but signficantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

9. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category: 
   I was making an attempt to have the program accept csv files to begin training on, 
   but I could not get it to work properly before the due date. So I took it off and 
   just settled for the 93% area of  the assignment until I can get it to accept files
   and not have code in the program that doesn't work. I will eventually create a user interface
   that will allow the user to choose to use the data provided or upload a file and choose which
   algorithm the user would like to use.
